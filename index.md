 My name is Mathews Almeida and I am a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering, intending on a concentration of Drug Delivery and Biomaterials. Currently, I conduct research in the Yang Lab, where I have coated different cells with different charged polyelectrolytes. Through researching in the Yang Lab, I have developed skills in literature review, layer-by-layer cell coating, and Atomic Force Microscopy. I am extremly interested in Research and Development at companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron and I aim to work at either company.
