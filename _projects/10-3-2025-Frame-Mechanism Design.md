For a class, we were asked to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length of our choosing, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator from a catalog. 

For my design, I worked within the 150 cm by 50 cm design space and chose a rigid bar pinned at the right end to act as the main lever arm. I used two ground-mounted pins and a third pin at the bar–actuator connection, which allowed me to explore different ways the actuator could drive the system.

In the sketch, I showed three possible actuator placements, each in a different color to represent a different design scenario. The blue actuator is mounted closer to the free end of the bar, at a steep diagonal. This version gives the greatest lifting height because the bar is pushed through a large vertical range, but it demands a stronger actuator since the mechanical advantage is lower. The white actuator in the center is more vertical and pushes at midspan. I see this as the “balanced” option—it provides a decent amount of height while keeping the force requirement more reasonable. Finally, the red actuator is mounted close to the pivot. This placement gives the largest mechanical advantage, so it can lift more weight with the same actuator, but it sacrifices lifting height since the bar’s motion is smaller.

Overall, I designed this mechanism to show how actuator placement changes the trade-off between maximum load and maximum lift height. My goal was to demonstrate that the same bar and pin layout can be tuned for different performance priorities, depending on whether lifting height or lifting force is more important.
